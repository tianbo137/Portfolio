This repository contains the steps to install Apache Spark, and run an application that consumes the twitter's real-time stream, performs transformations on the data and displays them on a real-time dashboard in Jupyter Notebook.

If you have a windows system, you need to create a linux virtual machine. Instructions are given in SetupLinuxVM.md.

Refer SetupSparkEnvironment.md to install and setup Spark.

RunningTwitterApplication.md explains how to run the application.
