The data is provided as a CSV and consists of the time of accident, the geographical coordinates, and other information such as cause of accident, vehicles involved, fatalities, etc. 

## Objective

Here are the steps I took for the project:

* I collected, cleaned, and analyzed the data.
* Created heat maps — static and with time that shows accidents by location, for the year, over a map of NJ, for visualization.
